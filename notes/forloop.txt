# For loop implementation

The for loops look pretty much pythonish for loop reason being I did not want to over complicate it.

To get item based for loop you use this.

```
f(x) = {
     for i: (x) {
         # Do what ever with i
     }
}
```

## Iterator implementation

Iterators is finally achieved.

```
for i: 0..10 {
    # Do what u want with i.
    print(i)
}
```


## Variadic implementation

Variadic could be implementated with ... I opted for simple approach of $.

```
strcut Array {
    arr,
    Append(self, $args) = {
         for i: ($args) {
             self.arr.append(i)
         }
    }
}
```

-- Variadic syntax should be easy to iterate

## Struct Parsing with for loops

When having a struct I want to be able to iterate between the members and its values.

```
strcut Person {
    married,
    name,
    age,
}

p = Person {
  married: False,
  name: "penger",
  age: 18,
}

for i, j: (array) {
    print("Key: % -> %", i, j)
}

```
