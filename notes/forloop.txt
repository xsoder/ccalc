# For loop implementation

The for loops look pretty much pythonish for loop reason being I did not want to over complicate it.

To get item based for loop you use this.

```
f(x) = {
     for i: (x) {
         # Do what ever with i
     }
}
```

## Variadic implementation

Variadic could be implementated with ... I opted for simple approach of $.

```
strcut Array {
    arr,
    Append(self, $args) = {
         for i: ($args) {
             self.arr.append(i)
         }
    }
}
```
